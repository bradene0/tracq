This is a porject to allow a user to track exercise in minutes and have it displayed using a UI/UX similar to how Github displays commits. The user will be able to login with clerk and see an array of boxes. The boxes represent dates which can be viewed via Hover and if clicked, the user can input the minutes exercised that day into the box. Depending on the relative amount of time, a color gradient will be applied to the box. Once submitted, on hover it shows the date and the minutes exercised.
